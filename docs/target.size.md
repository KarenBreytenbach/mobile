Given the rise of mobile devices it has never been more important to consider the size of a finger.

Users interact with pages using fingers that need much more space than a simple cursor. Thus the targets on which users can tap ("Tap Targets") to interact with the app must be at least big enough to comfortable click using a finger.

The advised sites from companies like Google are [48px by 48px](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/SizeTapTargetsAppropriately) (if the viewport is configured correctly).

# How do I fix this ?

Tag targets (links / buttons) must be, at a minimum, 48px by 48px to allow users to interact with said components. Enlarge the given targets to solve the issue.
