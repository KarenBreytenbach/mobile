The viewport controls how your webpage is rendered on mobile devices. If no viewport is specified mobile devices will try to render with typical desktop width for compatibility which breaks user experience.

The page has the tag configured but upon inspection has elements rendered bigger than the width of the screen. Meaning users would not be able to interact with the item without scrolling or not at all.

This issue could signify a website that has not been built to handle mobile screens but has been configured and rendered using a scaled viewport for phones. Non-responsive sites often fall in this category.
